{"name":"Scores","body":"This repo is for scores I have typeset, mainly using Lilypond but possibly using other tools in the future.\r\n\r\nThis music is old americana now the public domain. It's folk, jazz, blues, ragtime, bluegrass.\r\n\r\nI am typesetting this music for my own use, mainly to teach songs to musicians I play with. So things here are quirky. There's no one standard format. There's no one standard toolset or build process.\r\n\r\nWhen I start a new score I make a copy of my most recent one and start tweaking. Over time my latest code becomes pretty good but my earlier code stays bad.\r\n\r\nThese are just my versions of the tunes, suitable for my own performances. I don't try to do a canonical version.","tagline":"Lilypond transcriptions of public domain music","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
