This repo is for scores I have typeset, mainly using Lilypond but possibly using other tools in the future.

This music is old americana now the public domain. It's folk, jazz, blues, ragtime, bluegrass.

I am typesetting this music for my own use, mainly to teach songs to musicians I play with. So things here are quirky. There's no one standard format. There's no one standard toolset or build process. 

When I start a new score I make a copy of my most recent one and start tweaking. Over time my latest code becomes pretty good but my earlier code stays bad. What can I say... You're free to make improvements to what I have here.

There is no such thing as a canonical score for a song. A score can have more details or less. It can be transcription of one performance or an average of all performances. It can have little expressive touches added by the typesetter, such as arranging details. Them's the breaks.

lily-compile.sh is a useful script on my machine. It's not an ambitious project. Maybe it will be useful to you.

For now I don't include compiled PDFs here because of risks that they will create copyright problems. Maybe that isn't necessary, I don't know.
