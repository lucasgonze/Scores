This repo is for scores I have typeset, mainly using Lilypond but possibly using other tools in the future.

This music is old americana now the public domain. It's folk, jazz, blues, ragtime, bluegrass.

I am typesetting this music for my own use, mainly to teach songs to musicians I play with. So things here are quirky. There's no one standard format. There's no one standard toolset or build process. 

When I start a new score I make a copy of my most recent one and start tweaking. Over time my latest code becomes pretty good but my earlier code stays bad.

These are just my versions of the tunes, suitable for my own performances. I don't try to do a canonical version.

lily-compile.sh is a useful script on my machine. Maybe it will be useful to you.

For now I don't include compiled PDFs here because of risks that they will create copyright problems. Maybe that isn't necessary, I don't know.
