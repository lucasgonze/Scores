	Hy- po- crite and the
	con- cu- bine, 
	Liv- in' a- mong the 
	swine, They

	run to God with the 
	lips and tongue and
	leave all the heart be-
	hind

	Aun- ty, did you hear when 
	Je- sus rose?
	Did you hear when Je- sus 
	rose?
	
	Aun- ty, did you hear when
	Je- sus rose? He
	rose and he 'scend on 
	high.
